=====

My solution to the infamous CMU Cache lab - implementing a cache and optimized matrix transpose in C. The cache simulator file csim.c takes a reference trace file (given from school) of recorded memory accesses and reports the hits/misses based on different cache configurations. The matrix transpose file trans.c causes as few cache misses as possible across different sized matrices.
